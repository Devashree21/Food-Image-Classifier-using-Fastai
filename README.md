FastAI: Building a Food Image Classifier using Fastai

Here is a short FAQ about this repository

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are going to build an image classifier using fastai and identify a few food images using a library called ‘fastai‘.

**2) What is FastAI?**

FastAI is an open-source Deep Learning library that offers practitioners high-level components that can produce state-of-the-art results in conventional deep learning domains rapidly and effortlessly. It gives researchers low-level components to mix and combine to create new techniques. It aims to accomplish both without compromising usability, flexibility, or performance.

**3) Which dataset has been used?**

A lot of academic datasets are available through the fastai library. One of them is FOOD, which is listed under URLs. FOOD.

Details of this tutorial and model setup are discussed in my article https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/06/building-a-food-image-classifier-using-fastai/ published on Analytics Vidhya.
